# Pentago-SwapAI Introduction

The Codebase for an independent A.I Agent that can intelligently play the Pentago swap board game.
Built as a year 2 Computer Science Student for a course at school where for our final project a tournament of over 300 students was held and everyones agent played against one anothers. 

This A.I won 70% of 600 games in the tournament and was implemented using a variant of the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm. The algorithm was optimized to be able to search up to 10 moves ahead in less than 2 seconds.

I learned a lot about algorithm optimization while building this project as well as how to effectivley convert a winning strategy into functioning code.

Some of the limitations of my project is my coding style and maintainability. I have worked on my ability to write simple and modular code as a result of this project.

This project got me very excited and inspired me to build another A.I for the 2048 mini-game on my own time as a passion project which is also on my Github.

# Additional Information

Only the files in `src/StudentPlayer` were authoured by me the remaining code is starter code to run a server to facilitate competitions and testing
